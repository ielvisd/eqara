---

## 🎯 Opening (15 seconds)

**What to say:**
> "Hey! I'm going to show you Eqara - an AI math tutor that uses proven pedagogy to help you learn 4x faster than traditional methods. It's built on cognitive science research and brings one-on-one tutoring to everyone."

**What to do:**
- Start on the homepage/landing page
- Quick pan of the interface

---

## 1️⃣ Diagnostic Test (30 seconds)

**What to say:**
> "First, Eqara figures out exactly what you know with a diagnostic test. This finds your 'knowledge frontier' - the perfect level for you to learn at."

**What to do:**
- Click to start diagnostic
- Answer 2-3 questions quickly
- Click "I Don't Know" on one question
- Say: "Notice the 'I Don't Know' button? Being honest gets you better placement."

---

## 2️⃣ Socratic Chat (45 seconds)

**What to say:**
> "Now let me show you the teaching style. I'll ask about a simple problem..."

**What to do:**
- Type in a math problem (e.g., "2x + 5 = 13" or "What's a derivative?")
- Show the AI responding with questions, not answers
- Respond to 2-3 back-and-forth prompts
- Point out the XP counter when it updates
- Say: "See? It guides you with questions, never just gives answers. And you earn XP based on actual learning time."

## 3️⃣ Knowledge Graph (30 seconds)

**What to say:**
> "Here's the coolest part - the Knowledge Graph shows how all math topics connect."

**What to do:**
- Click to open Knowledge Graph
- Switch to graph view if available
- Point to different colored nodes:
  - "Green = mastered"
  - "Yellow = your frontier, what you learn next"
  - "Gray = locked until you're ready"
- Say: "This ensures you never waste time on stuff you know or get confused by stuff you're not ready for."

---

## 4️⃣ Spaced Repetition (30 seconds)

**What to say:**
> "Learning isn't just about moving forward - you need to review. Eqara uses spaced repetition with something called the FIRe algorithm."

**What to do:**
- Show the reviews section or due reviews
- Click to start a review
- Do 1-2 review questions
