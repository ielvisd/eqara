# 🎬 Eqara Demo Video Script (2-3 minutes)

**Format:** Simple screen recording with you in corner (webcam), narrating as you demo the app

**Length:** 2-3 minutes

**Perspective:** First-time user trying the app

---

## 🎯 Opening (0:00 - 0:15)

**Screen:** Homepage/landing page

**What to say:**
> "Hey! I'm going to show you Eqara - an AI math tutor that personalizes learning based on research-backed pedagogy. It adapts to your exact level and only teaches you what you're ready to learn. Let's see how it works."

**What to do:**
- Quick pan of the homepage
- Point out the clean interface

---

## 1️⃣ Diagnostic & Placement (0:15 - 0:45)

**Screen:** Diagnostic test page

**What to say:**
> "First, Eqara figures out exactly what you know with a diagnostic test. This finds your 'knowledge frontier' - the perfect boundary between what you've mastered and what you're ready to learn next."

**What to do:**
- Click "Take Placement Test" or start diagnostic
- Answer 2-3 questions quickly
- Click "I Don't Know" on one question
- Say: "Notice the 'I Don't Know' button? Being honest gets you better placement - there's no penalty for skipping questions you don't know."
- Show the results/frontier topics identified

---

## 2️⃣ Socratic Chat Tutoring (0:45 - 1:30)

**Screen:** Main chat interface

**What to say:**
> "Now let me show you the teaching style. I'll ask about a simple problem, and watch how the AI guides me with questions instead of giving direct answers."

**What to do:**
- Type in a math problem (e.g., "How do I solve 2x + 5 = 13?")
- Show the AI responding with questions, not answers
- Respond back once or twice showing the back-and-forth
- Point out the XP counter when it updates
- Say: "See? It guides you with questions, never just gives answers. That's the Socratic method - it builds real understanding, not just memorization. And you earn XP based on actual learning time - about 1 XP per minute of focused work."

---

## 3️⃣ Knowledge Graph (1:30 - 2:00)

**Screen:** Knowledge Graph sidebar/modal

**What to say:**
> "Here's the coolest part - the Knowledge Graph shows how all math topics connect."

**What to do:**
- Click to open Knowledge Graph
- Switch to graph view if available
- Point to different colored nodes:
  - "Green = mastered"
  - "Yellow = your frontier, what you learn next"
  - "Gray = locked until you're ready"
- Say: "This ensures you never waste time on stuff you know or get confused by stuff you're not ready for. You can only advance when you've mastered 100% of the prerequisites - no shortcuts, just real learning."

---

## 4️⃣ Spaced Repetition Reviews (2:00 - 2:30)

**Screen:** Review session or due reviews indicator

**What to say:**
> "Learning isn't just about moving forward - you need to review. Eqara uses spaced repetition with something called the FIRe algorithm to schedule reviews at the perfect time."

**What to do:**
- Click the review button/badge (if visible) or show due reviews
- Start a review session
- Do 1-2 review questions
- Say: "The cool part? When you review an advanced topic, it automatically updates simpler prerequisite topics too. One review, multiple topics reinforced - that's what makes it efficient."

---

## 5️⃣ Closing (2:30 - 2:45)

**Screen:** Dashboard with progress/XP/level

**What to say:**
> "So that's Eqara: personalized placement that finds your exact level, Socratic teaching that builds real understanding, intelligent knowledge sequencing so you never waste time, and smart reviews that optimize retention. It's like having a one-on-one tutor that knows exactly where you are and what you need next - powered by AI, grounded in research."

**What to do:**
- Show the dashboard with progress/XP/level
- End on a clean view of the app
